In this course, we take a deep dive into the world of RESTful Web Services & Microservice. Crux of the course are the sections on RESTful web services & Micro Services with Spring Cloud

We would start with the basics of RESTful Web Services - HTTP Request Methods, How do you do exception handling, validation and HATEOAS
before moving into the advanced concepts related to REST.

How do you document RESTful Web services?
How do you version them?
How do you implement filtering?
How do you monitor your RESTful Web services?
And we will also talk about content negotiation and internationalization.

The framework we will be using in this part of the course are Spring, Spring Boot, Maven and IDE Eclipse

After that we will move into the world of microservices with Spring Cloud.
We will understand the challenges in building micro services and we would look at the various solutions which are provided by spring cloud.

We would start with building a limits service and using it to talk to Spring cloud config server. We would implement load balancing with ribbon and Feign and
we would also implement a Eureka naming server. One of the main challenges with micro services is visibility into what's happening with the microservices.

What's happening in the background? We would implement an API gateway with Zuul and also distributed tracing with Zipkin to get more visibility into the Microservices.
We would make our micro services fault tolerant using Hysterix. All the details of the course including this step by step details are on a Github repository.
This course is centered around two key sections. RESTful Services with Spring Boot and Microservices with Spring Cloud. After learning to build rest web services and
microservices with spring boot and Spring Cloud, you will also learn to containerised them using Docker and orchestrate them with Kubernetes in this course.
